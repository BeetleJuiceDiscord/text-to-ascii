# text-to-ascii
A simple program I made to convert normal text in to cool text, I made this because I was bored at 5 AM and had nothing better to do

## installation
In your terminal, write "py -m pip install os", "py -m pip install requests", and "py -m pip install time", then just run main.py and you are done! All converted text will be logged to ascii.txt
